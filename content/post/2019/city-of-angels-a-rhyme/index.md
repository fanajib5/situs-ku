There was a girl with a sky full of stars in her eyes<br/>
She was chasing a world that was so fast it left her behind<br/>
She ran for days but the days became years<br/>
Hope went away as her smile turned to tears<br/>
But now there's lines on the face of the girl with the stars in her eyes<br/>

Sing me a symphony, one for the lost and in between<br/>
A city of fallen dreams<br/>
A city of angels<br/>
Sing back the melody, a song for the hearts left in the streets<br/>
A voice for the out of reach<br/>
The city of angels<br/>

There was a boy with the world in the palm of his hand<br/>
Bright like a star but he burned everything that he had<br/>
Traded his life punching holes in his veins<br/>
The thrill of the high was a long fall from grace<br/>
But if you listen close you can still hear the boy in the man<br/>

Sing me a symphony, one for the lost and in between<br/>
A city of fallen dreams<br/>
A city of angels<br/>
Sing back the melody, a song for the hearts left in the streets<br/>
A voice for the out of reach<br/>
The city of angels<br/>

Lost but not forgotten<br/>
Voices for the broken<br/>
Can you hear them calling<br/>

_This is some piece of a song lyrics from "The City of Angels &mdash; Arrow to Athens"._
